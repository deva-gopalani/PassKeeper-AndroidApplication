# PassKeeper-AndroidApplication

This is an app which would help one to store their passwords. The passwords captured by the app are encrypted and then stored on Firebase. to perform encryption, the **AES encryption algorithm** has been used.<br /><br />
The **key** used for **encryption** is taken as an input from the user itself in the form of a **paraphrase.** The maximum length of the paraphrase is of 16. Once the password is stored in the database, the user can decrypt the password only with the help of the paraphrase he had entered during encryption.<br /><br />
The app is also equipped with **biometric authentication.** For every time a user edits an already stored password or if the user were to delete a password entry he would have to perform his biometric authentication. Biometric authentication also has to be performed everytime when the user opens the app thus ensuring the fact that nobody except the owner of the phone can access the passwords. <br /><br />
